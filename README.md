# Real-Time Feedback Sentiment Analysis System

## Overview

The Press Information Bureau (PIB) Sentiment Analysis System is a comprehensive solution designed to automate the feedback process, analyze public sentiment regarding the government of India, and provide valuable insights to government ministries. This README provides an overview of the project's approach, features, and how to use the system effectively.

## Approach/Solution

### Data Collection and Preparation
- We initiate the process by collecting extensive and up-to-date data from regional and national newspaper websites using web crawling techniques.

### Sentiment Analysis
- The heart of our system lies in sentiment analysis, where we utilize the VADER sentiment analysis tool to categorize news articles into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments, specifically concerning the government of India.

### Model Fine-Tuning and Departmental Analysis
- Our sentiment analysis model is fine-tuned using data sourced from the Indian Publication Bureau, ensuring precise sentiment analysis tailored to government topics and policies. We also offer sentiment analysis based on different government departments, providing nuanced insights.

### User-Friendly Dashboard
- We prioritize user accessibility by featuring a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard allows seamless navigation and interaction with sentiment analysis results, including sorting and filtering options for news articles.

### Ministry Insights
- A core focus of our system is to empower government ministries with real-time feedback on public sentiment surrounding their policies. This invaluable information enables ministries to make informed, data-driven adjustments for improved public relations.

### User-Submitted Sentiment Analysis
- We've simplified the process for individual users to quickly analyze the sentiment of specific news articles by pasting the text on our homepage.

### Security Measures for Ministry Tab
- We take data security seriously. Access to the Ministry Tab, where sensitive information is likely stored, is restricted to authorized department administrators via secure login credentials.

### Fake News Detection
- Our system includes a robust fake news detection feature employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Users can paste news articles to assess their authenticity, contributing to the fight against misinformation.

### YouTube Link Checker
